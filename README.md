## About

Goilerplate is a growing library of modern UI components designed specifically for Go and Templ. It leverages Alpine.js for enhanced interactivity and Tailwind CSS for effortless styling. Whether you're building a small website or a large web application, Goilerplate provides the tools you need to create sleek, responsive interfaces with ease.

## Features

- **Go-native Implementation**: Optimized for Go developers, seamlessly integrating with Go backends.

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Focus**: Excellent performance and SEO benefits out of the box.
- **Alpine.js Integration**: Enhanced client-side interactivity when needed.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Modern, utility-first styling that's highly customizable.
- **Accessible Components**: Built with accessibility in mind, following WCAG guidelines.

## Inspiration

Goilerplate draws inspiration from several popular UI libraries and frameworks:

- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [Pines UI](https://devdojo.com/pines)
- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)

We're exploring whether to make Goilerplate a strict port of shadcn/ui or to create a unique blend of various inspirations. The project is still evolving, and community feedback will play a crucial role in shaping its direction.
